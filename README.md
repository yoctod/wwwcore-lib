Wwwcore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript wwwcoin library. Fork from [bitcore-lib](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib).

A pure and powerful JavaScript Litecoin library.

## Principles

Wwwcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Wwwcoin network allows for highly resilient litecoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement wwwcoin apps and services.

## Get Started

```
npm install wwwcore-lib
```

```
bower install wwwcore-lib
```

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [wwwcore documentation](http://wwwcore.io/guide/). There's also a [litecore API reference](http://litecore.io/api/) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each wwwcore utility.
